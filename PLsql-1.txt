IF(TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'DY')IN('SAT','SUN')) OR 
(TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'HH24:MI') NOT BETWEEN '08' AND '15')
THEN RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20500,'You may insert into employees table only during business hours');
END IF;
END;
 
SELECT * FROM MPHASISEMP;

insert into mphasisemp values(105,'SUNIL','sunil@gmail.com',45000,20,5);
